# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Students enroled in the Trilogy Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development must complete the assigned pre-work before class begins in early December.

The main goal of this pre-work is to introduce students to the topics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

Since the bootcamp will apply a "learn by doing" approach, so does the pre-work.

That is where this project comes in: students work incrementally on the PreWork Study Guide Webpage, by adding their own notes on each of the previously mentioned topics, whilst also seeing those same notes in action.

## Usage

Since this is meant to be used as a study guide, you can easily review my notes for each section.

For some of them, as suggested by the `header`, make sure you check the console (use `Command+Option+I` for macOS or `Control+Shift+I` for Windows) for some ✨ coding magic! ✨
